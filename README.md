## What Is This?

Stellar Dev Dashboard is a browser-based developer tool for exploring and interacting with the Stellar blockchain. You enter any Stellar public key and get a full view of that account — balances, transactions, operations, contracts, network stats, and more. It supports both Mainnet and Testnet, connects to real wallets (Freighter, Ledger), and lets you build, simulate, and sign transactions directly in the UI.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # development server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # production build → dist/
npm run preview   # preview the production build
```

Node 18+ recommended. No environment variables required — all API calls go directly to public Stellar Horizon and Soroban RPC endpoints.

## Features In Detail

### Connect Panel
The landing screen. Enter any valid Stellar public key (`G...`) and click Connect. The app validates the key with `StrKey.isValidEd25519PublicKey`, loads the account from Horizon, then fetches the first 20 transactions and operations in parallel in the background. Pressing Enter also triggers the connect.

### Overview
Summary dashboard for the connected account. Shows XLM balance with a USD estimate, number of non-native assets, recent transaction count, and the account sequence number. Below that is an asset holdings table with per-asset USD estimates (fetched from SDEX order books). The bottom section shows the 5 most recent transactions and live network stats (latest ledger, base fee, close time).

### Account Detail
Deep-dive into the connected account. Sections:
- Identity: public key, account ID, sequence number, creation date (fetched by finding the first `create_account` operation), XLM balance with USD estimate, subentry count, link to Stellar Expert
- Asset Balances: all non-native trustlines with issuer addresses and USD estimates
- Thresholds: low / medium / high signing thresholds
- Flags: auth_required, auth_revocable, auth_immutable, auth_clawback_enabled — shown as TRUE/FALSE badges
- Signers: all signers with their weights
- Open Offers: active SDEX sell offers for the account

### Transaction History
Tabbed view switching between Transactions and Operations. Both lists support cursor-based pagination — a "Load More" button appends the next 20 records without replacing existing ones. Transactions show hash (copyable), success/fail indicator, memo, fee in stroops, operation count, and timestamp. Operations show type label (human-readable via `OPERATION_LABELS` map), from/to addresses, and amount.

### Soroban Contracts
Two panels:

**Inspect Contract** — enter a contract address (`C...`), fetches the ledger entry via `SorobanRpc.Server.getContractData` and displays the raw JSON result.

**Invoke Contract** — build a contract call with:
- Contract ID, function name, source account
- Typed arguments (string, int, address, bool) — each parsed into the correct `ScVal` type
- Simulate button: calls `server.simulateTransaction` and shows return value, cost, events, and footprint (read-only / read-write ledger keys)
- Submit button (Testnet only): signs with a secret key, calls `server.prepareTransaction` then `server.sendTransaction`, shows hash and status

Mainnet safety mode disables submission but still allows simulation.

### Network Stats
Live network data with an SSE stream via `streamLedgers`. Shows:
- Latest ledger sequence, base fee, close time, successful/failed tx count, operation count
- Fee statistics table: min, mode, median, max, P10, P90 accepted fees
- Ledger close time chart (Recharts LineChart) — plots close interval in seconds for the last 20 ledgers with an average reference line
- Recent ledgers table (last 10)

### Testnet Faucet
Calls Friendbot (`https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<key>`) to fund any testnet account with 10,000 XLM. Pre-fills with the connected address. Disabled on Mainnet.

### Transaction Builder (Builder tab)
Simple builder for payment and createAccount operations. Supports source account, memo, base fee, and time bounds (min/max Unix timestamps). Simulate button validates operations and returns estimated fee. Export XDR button copies the unsigned transaction XDR to clipboard.

### Transaction Builder (txBuilder tab)
Extended builder with more operation types: payment, createAccount, changeTrust, accountMerge, manageData. Supports text/id/hash/return memo types. Uses `transactionBuilder.js` which has a full `createOperation` factory covering manageSellOffer, manageBuyOffer, setOptions, and more.

### Transaction Signer
Paste any unsigned transaction XDR and sign it with the connected wallet. Freighter signs via `api.signTransaction`. Ledger signing is noted as requiring the device to be connected. The signed XDR is displayed and can be copied.

### Wallet Connect
Connect a real wallet instead of entering a public key manually:
- **Freighter**: detects `window.freighterApi`, calls `requestAccess()` then `getAddress()`
- **Ledger**: checks WebUSB/WebHID support, dynamically imports `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb` and `@stellar/ledger` (optional peer deps), derives the public key from path `44'/148'/0'`

After connecting, the wallet's public key is set as the connected address and account data is loaded.

### Account Comparison
Compare up to 5 accounts side by side. Each slot has a public key input. Clicking "Compare All" fetches all accounts and their open offers in parallel. The comparison table shows: status, XLM balance, asset count, active orders, sequence number, subentries. Accounts can be sorted by balance, orders, or assets. Results can be exported as CSV. A `ComparisonChart` renders bar charts for visual comparison.

### Portfolio Value
Fetches USD prices for all held assets from CoinGecko (mapped via `ASSET_ID_MAP` in `priceFeed.js`). Displays total portfolio value and a per-asset breakdown with balance, price, and USD value. 24h price change indicators (↑/↓) are shown per asset.

### Price Ticker
Persistent bar at the top of every page showing the current XLM/USD price and 24h change, refreshed every 60 seconds from CoinGecko.

### DEX Explorer
Enter a selling asset (`native` or `CODE:ISSUER`) and a buying asset. Fetches the SDEX order book and recent trades via Horizon. Displays:
- Spread (absolute and percentage), best bid, best ask
- Aggregated bids and asks tables (top 10 levels with cumulative depth)
- Last 10 recent trades with price, amount, and time

### Path Explorer
Find cross-asset payment routes via Horizon's `/paths/strict-send` and `/paths/strict-receive` endpoints. Select source and destination assets (preset or custom), enter an amount, choose strict-send or strict-receive mode. Results are sorted by best rate and annotated with slippage percentage vs the best path.

### Real-Time Ledger
Live SSE stream of incoming ledgers using the `StreamManager` class in `streaming.js`. Shows connection status (connecting / live / reconnecting / error) with a pulsing indicator. Displays the latest ledger sequence, transaction count, and operation count as summary cards, plus a scrolling feed of all received ledgers. The stream uses exponential backoff (up to 30s, max 10 attempts) on errors.

### Explorer Integration
Generate deep links to external block explorers (Stellar Expert, Steexp) for accounts, transactions, contracts, assets, ledgers, and operations. Also shows quick-link cards to each explorer's homepage for the current network.

### Charts & Analytics
A combined view rendering three Recharts-based charts: NetworkMetricsChart, AccountActivityChart, and BalanceHistoryChart.

## State Management

All global state lives in a single Zustand store (`src/lib/store.ts`). The store is fully typed with TypeScript interfaces. Key state slices:

| Slice | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `network` | `'mainnet'` or `'testnet'` — switching resets account/tx/ops data |
| `connectedAddress` | The currently viewed public key |
| `accountData` | Full `Horizon.AccountResponse` |
| `transactions` / `operations` | Arrays with cursor-based pagination state |
| `networkStats` | Latest ledger + fee stats |
| `activeTab` | Which dashboard tab is rendered |
| `contractId` / `contractData` | Soroban contract inspector state |
| `faucetLoading` / `faucetResult` | Faucet request state |
| Comparison slots | Array of `{ key, data, loading, error }` for multi-account view |
| Stream state | `streamStatus`, `streamLedgers` for the real-time ledger feed |
| Prices | CoinGecko price map keyed by asset code |
| Notifications | Array of `{ id, type, title, message }` |
| Wallet | `walletConnected`, `walletType`, `walletPublicKey` |

---

## Network Configuration

Defined in `src/lib/stellar.ts`:

| Network | Horizon URL | Soroban RPC URL |
|---|---|---|
| Testnet | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| Mainnet | `https://horizon.stellar.org` | `https://soroban-rpc.stellar.org` |

The network switcher in the sidebar calls `setNetwork()` which resets all account-specific state.

---

## TypeScript Migration

The project is mid-migration from JavaScript to TypeScript. The Vite config sets `.ts` to resolve before `.js`, so imports of `stellar` and `store` automatically use the typed versions. `tsconfig.json` covers `src/lib/**/*.ts` with strict mode enabled. `allowJs: true` and `checkJs: false` let the remaining `.jsx` components import from the typed lib files without errors.

---

## Styling

All design tokens are CSS custom properties defined in `globals.css`. The app supports dark and light themes via a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`, set reactively from the Zustand `theme` state. Fonts are Space Mono (monospace, used for addresses, hashes, numbers) and Syne (display, used for headings). All component styles are inline — no CSS modules or Tailwind.

---

## Accessibility

- `ScreenReaderAnnouncer` renders an ARIA live region; components call `announceToScreenReader()` from `utils/accessibility.js` to push messages
- `KeyboardNavigation` handles focus trapping for modal-like panels
- `accessibility.css` provides focus ring styles and `prefers-reduced-motion` overrides
- `ErrorBoundary` wraps the app and renders `ErrorFallback` on uncaught errors
